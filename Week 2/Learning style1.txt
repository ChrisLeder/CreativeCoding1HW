You are a Visual learner! Check out the information below, or view all of the learning styles.
Visual
If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.
Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:
* Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)
* Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.
* Use flashcards to learn new words.
* Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.
* Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.
* Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.
* Color code things.
* Avoid distractions during study times.
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.

 I think that learning styles can help with motivation to learn.  I feel that if we are using a learning style that is more comfortable, mentally, or that we have a positive mindset towards, we are more likely to put forth the effort to learn.

I know that when I am in a live discussion situation, I tend to retain information better because of the interactions, the visual and sound connections created during the discussion. I also know that reading supports my ability to learn, because I can often return to information I feel uncertain about until I am confident in my retention of the information. 

There are research findings that show that use of preferred learning style does not improve ones ability to learn. I think that to improve your ability to learn, you have to find and develop skills and methods that work for you.
