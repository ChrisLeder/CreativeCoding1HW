I scored 39 on the mindset quiz, twice. I tend to not trust ‘quiz’ results, in that I feel that our self- perception for lack of a better word, and our desire to be seen in a certain way, can influence the choices we make. So, I took the quiz, then I took a break for about ten minutes, (getting a drink and a snack), then I took it again from bottom to top. Same exact result. This shows that I have a growth mindset with few fixed ideas. I feel that this is an accurate representation of who I am. I have often in the past failed to try something or explore something because I didn’t have the skillset to do it, or I just wasn’t ‘Built’ that way. How many opportunities were missed based on my own sense of inadequacy.
