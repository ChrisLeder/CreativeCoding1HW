				Reflection 		
			         The last Lecture

I have to say that the first feeling I had while watching The Last Lecture given By Randy Pausch, was sadness. However by the end of the lecture, while I still had feelings of sadness, I would say that I felt more hopeful, and motivated. I related to the information presented on a basic level, in that I achieved dreams that I didn’t know that I had. I had such a positive impact on so many lives in my 25 year career as a Pediatric Nurse. 
I also realized that I was my own ‘Brickwall’. Telling myself what I was incapable of instead of figuring out ways to overcome obstacles to my desires. Now it’s time for me to dismantle those walls, brick by brick.
